# DiabTrack – Menstrual Biomarkers Aware Diabetes Prediction

## Introduction
DiabTrack is a machine learning–based diabetes risk prediction system that
integrates menstrual and metabolic biomarkers to enhance early screening accuracy.

## Project Structure
- data/ – Raw and processed datasets
- train_and_save.py – Model training and persistence
- app.py – Streamlit-based web application
- model files – Saved model, scaler, and metadata

## Git Workflow
- Feature-based branching
- Validation through test branches
- Bug fixes isolated from development
- Experimental UI exploration
- Controlled merges into main

## Branching Strategy
- feature/preprocessing-pipeline
- test/evaluation-suite
- bugfix/documentation-cleanup
- experiment/alt-ui

## Merge Conflict Demonstration
A planned conflict was created in README.md to combine
machine learning and medical perspectives on diabetes prediction.

## Commands Used
git init, add, commit, branch, checkout, merge, stash, rebase, push, pull, clone

## Challenges
- Managing parallel feature development
- Resolving conceptual documentation conflicts

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates professional Git usage for
machine learning research, ensuring reproducibility,
clean collaboration, and reliable deployment.
